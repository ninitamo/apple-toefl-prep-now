  'Summarize the points made in the lecture, explaining how they provide a different perspective on the points made in the reading passage.',
  'A complete response should address: 1) Air quality complexities (volatile organic compounds from some plants, pollution trapping in narrow streets vs. simple air filtering claim), 2) Accessibility and safety factors affecting recreational use (maintenance and safety issues in lower-income areas vs. general physical activity benefits), 3) Seasonal energy considerations (blocked sunlight increasing heating costs, water maintenance requirements vs. cooling benefits), 4) Wildlife management challenges (unwelcome species like pigeons/rats, invasive plants disrupting ecosystems vs. biodiversity support). The response should demonstrate understanding that while green spaces offer benefits, their implementation requires careful planning to address potential drawbacks.',
  'The response should demonstrate understanding that urban green spaces have both benefits and challenges that require careful city planning consideration.'
