    'Academic Discussion Task: Join a class discussion about the effectiveness of online learning compared to traditional classroom learning.',
    'Professor: Today, we''re discussing the effectiveness of online learning compared to traditional in-person classes. Some people argue that online learning gives students more flexibility and access to resources. Others believe in-person classes offer better interaction, focus, and overall learning outcomes. What''s your view? Is online learning just as effective as classroom learning?

Alicia: I think online learning is very effective, especially for students who need flexibility. You can review materials at your own pace, which is great for different learning styles. Plus, online platforms often offer recorded lectures, discussion forums, and extra resources. For motivated students, online learning can be just as good as in-person classesâ€”maybe even better.

Sam: I disagree. In my experience, in-person classes provide more structure and fewer distractions. It''s easier to stay focused and ask questions on the spot. Also, face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates builds communication skills and motivation. While online learning is convenient, I don''t think it matches the depth and quality of in-person education.',
