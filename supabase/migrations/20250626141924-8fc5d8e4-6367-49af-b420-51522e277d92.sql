-- Test 6 Task 2 (Campus-related)
(6, 'speaking', 'Changes to Campus Shuttle Service', 'The university will be changing its campus shuttle service next semester. Instead of running every 15 minutes, the shuttle will run every 30 minutes due to budget cuts. The administration hopes that by reducing frequency, they can save money without significantly affecting students. The shuttle route will remain the same, covering all major campus locations. To encourage alternative transportation, the university plans to improve bike lanes and promote carpooling programs. Student opinions about these changes have been mixed.', 2, 60, 'integrated-campus'),

-- Test 6 Task 3 (Academic Reading + Lecture)
(6, 'speaking', 'The Concept of Social Loafing', 'Social loafing occurs when individuals exert less effort when working in a group than when working alone. This phenomenon happens because people feel less accountable for the outcome and believe others will compensate for their lack of effort. Social loafing can reduce group productivity and create frustration among team members who do contribute fully. To reduce social loafing, groups can set clear roles and responsibilities, establish individual accountability, and foster strong motivation. Awareness of social loafing is important in both academic and professional settings to improve teamwork and performance.', 3, 120, 'integrated-academic'),

-- Test 7 Task 2 (Campus-related)
(7, 'speaking', 'New Policy on Textbook Rentals', 'The university library is introducing a textbook rental program next semester to reduce costs for students. Instead of purchasing expensive textbooks, students can rent them for the semester at a fraction of the price. The library will stock the most required books for popular courses. However, textbooks must be returned by the last day of classes, and late returns will incur fines. The program aims to make textbooks more affordable but may limit access if demand exceeds supply.', 2, 60, 'integrated-campus'),

-- Test 7 Task 3 (Academic Reading + Lecture)
(7, 'speaking', 'The Concept of Cognitive Dissonance', 'Cognitive dissonance is a psychological theory that explains the discomfort people feel when they hold two or more contradictory beliefs or values at the same time. To reduce this discomfort, individuals often change their attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors to restore harmony. For example, if a person who values health smokes cigarettes, they might rationalize the behavior by downplaying the risks or convincing themselves they can quit anytime. Cognitive dissonance influences decision-making and motivation, and understanding it helps psychologists explain why people sometimes act irrationally.', 3, 120, 'integrated-academic'),

(8, 'speaking', 'Library Noise Policy Change', 'The university library will soon designate specific areas for group work and conversation. In the past, all library spaces were considered silent zones, but students have increasingly requested more collaborative space. The first and second floors will now be designated for quiet conversation and group study, while the third floor will remain a strict silent zone. Library officials believe this change will allow both independent and collaborative learners to use the space more comfortably.', 2, 60, 'integrated-campus'),

-- Test 8 Task 3 (Academic Reading + Lecture)
(8, 'speaking', 'Opportunity Cost', 'Opportunity cost refers to the value of the next best alternative that must be given up when a choice is made. In economics, every decision involves a trade-off. For example, if a student decides to spend time studying instead of going out with friends, the opportunity cost is the fun and relaxation they gave up. Opportunity cost helps individuals and businesses make more informed decisions by considering what is sacrificed. It is not just about moneyâ€”it includes time, effort, and any benefits lost by choosing one option over another. Recognizing opportunity costs encourages better decision-making and efficient use of resources.', 3, 120, 'integrated-academic'),

(9, 'speaking', 'New Online Attendance System', 'Beginning next semester, the university will introduce an online attendance tracking system for all lectures. Instead of taking attendance manually, students will log their attendance through a mobile app using their student ID. The administration believes this will save class time and reduce errors in record-keeping. However, some students have expressed concerns about technical issues and privacy. Professors will also have access to live reports and historical attendance data to monitor student participation more efficiently.', 2, 60, 'integrated-campus'),

-- Test 9 Task 3 (Academic Reading + Lecture)
(9, 'speaking', 'The Halo Effect', 'The halo effect is a type of cognitive bias in which our overall impression of a person influences how we perceive their individual traits. For instance, if someone is physically attractive, we may also assume they are intelligent or kind, even without real evidence. This bias can affect hiring decisions, academic evaluations, and social relationships. People tend to make quick judgments based on one positive characteristic and generalize it to others. The halo effect shows how first impressions and superficial traits can distort our perception and lead to biased decisions in everyday life.', 3, 120, 'integrated-academic'),

-- Test 9 Task 4 (Academic Lecture)

-- Test 10 Task 2 (Campus-related)
(10, 'speaking', 'New Dormitory Guest Policy', 'Starting next semester, the university will implement a stricter guest policy in on-campus housing. Visitors will only be allowed between 10 a.m. and 10 p.m., and overnight stays will no longer be permitted. The administration explains that this change aims to improve safety, reduce noise, and ensure that all residents have a comfortable living environment. Some students have voiced concerns about the policy being too restrictive, especially for those with family or partners visiting from out of town.', 2, 60, 'integrated-campus'),

-- Test 10 Task 3 (Academic Reading + Lecture)
(10, 'speaking', 'The Endowment Effect', 'The endowment effect is a cognitive bias in which individuals assign more value to things merely because they own them. In studies, people tend to demand significantly more money to sell an item they own than they would pay to acquire the same item if they did not already possess it. This bias can lead to irrational decisions in both personal and economic contexts. For example, someone who receives a coffee mug in a study may refuse to sell it for less than $5, even though they would not have been willing to pay more than $2 to buy one. The endowment effect reflects how emotional attachment and a sense of ownership distort objective valuation. In real life, this can affect negotiations, consumer behavior, and even legal settlements. Recognizing this bias helps people make more informed decisions and avoid overvaluing things just because they happen to own them.', 3, 130, 'integrated-academic'),

-- Test 10 Task 4 (Academic Lecture)
