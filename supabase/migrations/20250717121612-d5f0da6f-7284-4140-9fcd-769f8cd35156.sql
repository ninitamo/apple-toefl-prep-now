    'Professor: We''re discussing universal basic income (UBI)â€”a system in which the government gives every citizen a fixed amount of money, regardless of income or employment. Supporters say UBI reduces poverty and gives people freedom to pursue education or care for family. Critics argue it''s too expensive and may reduce motivation to work. What''s your opinion? Should governments provide a universal basic income?

Lena: I support UBI. It provides a safety net for everyone, especially as technology replaces jobs. People could take time to reskill, start businesses, or care for children without financial stress. It gives dignity and stability, which everyone deserves.

Owen: I don''t think UBI is a good idea. It''s incredibly expensive and might discourage people from working. Instead, we should focus on targeted support for those who really need it, like low-income families or the unemployed. Giving money to everyone doesn''t make economic sense.',
