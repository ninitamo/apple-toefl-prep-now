    'Academic Discussion Task: Join a psychology class discussion about the relationship between social media use and personal happiness.',
    'Professor: Today we''re discussing the relationship between social media use and happiness. Some researchers argue that social media helps people stay connected and can improve their mood. Others believe that excessive social media use can lead to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and low self-esteem. What''s your view? Does social media increase or decrease people''s happiness?

Maya: I think social media decreases happiness, especially when people compare themselves to others. Everyone posts only the best parts of their lives, and it creates unrealistic expectations. This leads to jealousy and low self-worth. I''ve seen this happen with my friends, and studies support it too.

Liam: I actually find social media uplifting. I use it to stay in touch with friends and family, especially those who live far away. It makes me feel connected. It all depends on how you use itâ€”if you''re mindful and limit your time, social media can be a positive thing.',
