    'Academic Discussion Task: Join a linguistics class discussion about the effectiveness of technology compared to traditional language learning methods.',
    'Professor: Let''s discuss how technology is changing language learning. Some people say that apps, online courses, and AI tools are making it easier than ever to learn a new language. Others believe these tools can''t replace real-world interaction and traditional classroom instruction. What do you think? Is technology an effective substitute for traditional language learning?

Lara: I think technology is a great tool for language learning. Apps like Duolingo or AI chatbots help learners practice anytime and anywhere. While they don''t fully replace real conversations, they are perfect for building vocabulary and confidence before speaking with others.

Noah: I believe that face-to-face interaction is essential. Language is not just about vocabularyâ€”it''s about culture, tone, and emotion. Apps can support learning, but they can''t replicate real human communication, which is necessary to become fluent.',
