  const passage = `The emergence of cities marked one of the most significant developments in human history. Before urban centers existed, humans lived in small, nomadic groups of hunter-gatherers. The transition from these mobile communities to settled, complex societies was largely made possible by the advent of agriculture, which allowed for the production of surplus food. With a stable food supply, populations could grow, and not everyone was required to be directly involved in food production. This development led to the creation of specialized roles in society, such as artisans, traders, and rulers.

Archaeological evidence suggests that some of the earliest cities emerged in Mesopotamia, in the fertile region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, around 3500 BCE. Cities such as Uruk, Ur, and Eridu showcased remarkable innovations for their time, including irrigation systems, written records, and monumental architecture. These urban centers became hubs of economic activity, religious worship, and political power.

Urbanization brought both advantages and challenges. On the positive side, cities enabled large-scale cooperation, leading to impressive achievements in art, architecture, and governance. The concentration of people and resources fostered trade networks and cultural exchange. However, urban living also introduced new problems. Overcrowding, disease, social inequality, and conflict over resources became persistent issues in many ancient cities.

Historians debate the precise causes and consequences of early urbanization. Some argue that environmental factors, such as access to fertile land and reliable water sources, were the primary drivers. Others suggest that social or religious factors played a key role, as urban centers often contained important temples and served as ceremonial hubs. Whatever the initial impetus, the rise of cities transformed human society, laying the groundwork for modern civilization.`;
